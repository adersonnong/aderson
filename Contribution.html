  Srinivasa Ramanujan (1887-1920)</p>
One of the greatest mathematicians of all time, Srinivasa Ramanujan was born in 1887 in the Southern part of India. He is still remembered for his contributions to the field of mathematics. Theorems formulated by him are to date studied by students across the world and within very few years of his lifespan, he made some exceptional discoveries in mathematics. </br>

Indian Mathematician S. Ramanujan – Biography</p>
Born in 1887, Ramanujan’s life, as said by Sri Aurobindo, was a “rags to mathematical riches” life story. His geniuses of the 20th century are still giving shape to 21st-century mathematics. </p>

Discussed below is the history, achievements, contributions, etc. of Ramanujan’s life journey.</br>

Birth – </p>

Srinivasa Ramanujan was born on 22nd December 1887 in the south Indian town of Tamil Nad, named Erode. 
His father, Kuppuswamy Srinivasa Iyengar worked as a clerk in a saree shop and his mother, Komalatamma was a housewife. 
Since a very early age, he had a keen interest in mathematics and had already become a child prodigy
Srinivasa Ramanujan Education – </p>

He attained his early education and schooling from Madras, where he was enrolled in a local school
His love for mathematics had grown at a very young age and was mostly self-taught
He was a promising student and had won many academic prizes in high school
But his love for mathematics proved to be a disadvantage when he reached college. As he continued to excel in only one subject and kept failing in all others. This resulted in him dropping out of college
However, he continued to work on his collection of mathematical theorems, ideologies and concepts until he got his final breakthrough
Final Break Through – </p>

S. Ramanujam did not keep all his discoveries to himself but continued to send his works to International mathematicians
In 1912, he was appointed at the position of clerk in the Madras Post Trust Office, where the manager, S.N. Aiyar encouraged him to reach out to G.H. Hardy, a famous mathematician at the Cambridge University
In 1913, he had sent the famous letter to Hardy, in which he had attached 120 theorems as a sample of his work
Hardy along with another mathematician at Cambridge, J.E.Littlewood analysed his work and concluded it to be a work of true genius
It was after this </p> 

In 1919, Ramanujan’s health had started to deteriorate, after which he decided to move back to India
After his return in 1920, his health further worsened and he died at the age of just 32 years</p>
